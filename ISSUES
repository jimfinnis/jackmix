Need to specify input and output ports in effects. See config for 
an example.
Need to connect those ports before running, and make sure checkPortsConnected doesn't get in
a tizzy about them


Crash on exit due to ladspa freeing stuff twice. I think I need to dlclose
all the libraries one by one on exit.

Need to check the value being given to an effect param is within range.

Be nice to have a way of mapping a known range (0-1) to the actual
range of an effect param, e.g. 
    gverb { "Roomsize (m)" default(ctrl) mapped
would specify that ctrl produced 0-1, and the effect would map it
itself. Chuffing hard because the value has nothing to do with the effect;
the source could write the value via the ctrl and the effect won't know.
