* add/remove channel
* add/remove chain
    - creates a null chain, ensure that works
    - automatically creates a return channel
    - removal must remove all sends for this chain from channels
    - remove the return channel
* add/remove effect from chain
* add control to value
    - ideally it would be possible to either select an existing
      control, or add a control and select that. I suspect the flow
      for this inside the UI would be messy. Or not? Just push the
      control edit screen?
