# how to do stereo/mono????

# any value with an ident in brackets is an initialisation value
# for something bound to a control (midi,Diamond) input.

chans {
    # actual inputs giving gain and any aux send
    piano       0.5(a)         send reverb post 0.2,
    guitar      0.2(b)
}   
    



fx {
    # loop name and return gain: chain of effects and params
    reverb 0.5(c) in 0.8:
        gverb {...}, spatializer {...}
}
    

# the control inputs specified above. Requires some kind of
# range remapping / log scaling parameters.

ctrl {
    a: knobs/1 in 0:1024 log,
