Channel architecture:

any number of inputs. Each input can be routed to any number of FX sends,
either post- or pre-fade.
Mono inputs are converted to stereo when sent, and the stereo return's gain
is given in the fx chain's specification. Each fx chain has a return gain,
an optional input gain, and a number of ladspa effects each with their
own parameters.

All values (gain, pans, fx params) have an optional ctrl channel name
in brackets. This specifies a control channel which can change the value.
Control channels have a name, an input (diamond variable, midi cc, OSC??)
and a mapping to apply to the input range. Input ranges are all normalized
to 0-1 (diamond has to make some assumptions here) before the mapping is
applied.

A single physical control input can control multiple control channels,
so (say) midi cc 15 on midi channel 1 can control several gains and pans.

Todo:
* control channel parsing and testing
* channel parsin
* basic mixing and panning
* effects chains
